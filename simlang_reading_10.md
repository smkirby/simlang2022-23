description: Overview of this view of language
---


This week we're going to try and pull together what we've learned in the course about how simulation models can help us understand central questions about the origins and nature of language. If you want an overview paper that covers the same ground, you could look at the review I wrote ([Kirby, 2017](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-016-1166-7)). I also recommend having a look at the critical commentaries to that article, particularly [Adger (2017)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-016-1194-3).

We'll end with four area that I think will be the focus of future research in simulating language.
